    "### Features of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python is interpreted\n",
    "1. Python is sensitive. EG print() vs Print()\n",
    "1. Indentations are important in Python. EG If else statements need to have a \":\" that follows. Inserting a tab after if or else is important as well\n",
    "1. We need to know the differences between english and variables in Python. EG name is a variable, \"name\" is a string.\n",
    "1. You can import packages from the library to use their functions. EG. import math will grant you the ability to use the square root function which basic Python does not offer\n",
    "1. Using \".\" is to indicate ownership of which module the function belongs to. EG numpy.sqrt() means that you are using the square root function from the numpy package\n",
    "1. \".\" also gives access to functions and attributes. EG. \"I am your father\".upper() converts every letter in the string to capital\n",
    "1. There is a difference between using \"[ ]\", \"()\" and \"{}\". \"()\" is to carry out functions. \"[]\" is to create lists. \"{}\" is to store data just like a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *= is not the same as ==*\n",
    "1. *use # to insert comments that will not be interpreted by Python when you run the cell*\n",
    "1. *A function is ‘something’ that executes a specific task.*\n",
    "1. *Use if to make decisions*"
